# Privacy Policy

**a-Shell** is a terminal emulator. It runs entirely locally, on your iOS device. It does not need a network connection. 
	

**a-Shell** does not collect any data, period. 

You can use a-Shell to create and edit files. You can process these files using grep, find, lua, python, TeX... All of this will happen on your device and you will be the only one to know. 

You can move the files created inside a-Shell outside of its own directory, into other applications directories. This is done by you, the user, as needed.
